# Notion Workspace Analytics

Automated analytics system for Notion workspaces. Generates comprehensive Markdown reports on usage, content health, collaboration patterns, and cost optimization.

## Features

- 📊 **Growth & Velocity** - Content creation trends over time with annual, quarterly, and monthly breakdowns
- 👥 **User Engagement** - Creator segmentation (power/active/occasional/minimal/non-creators), top contributors
- 🔍 **Content Health** - Staleness analysis, abandoned pages, content that needs attention
- 🤝 **Collaboration** - Cross-editing patterns, collaboration scores, knowledge sharing metrics
- 💰 **Cost Analysis** - Seat utilization, wasted spend identification, ROI calculations
- ⚠️ **Knowledge Risk** - Ownership concentration (Gini coefficient), bus factor analysis, single-point-of-failure detection
- 👻 **Deleted User Tracking** - Identifies content created by removed users that still remains in workspace

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Notion workspace (any plan type - Free, Plus, Business, or Enterprise)
- Workspace Owner or Admin access (required to create integrations)
- Notion workspace export (Markdown & CSV format)

## Installation

### 1. Clone or Download Repository

```bash
cd ~/Projects
git clone <repository-url> NotionUsageInsights
cd NotionUsageInsights
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# OR
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your credentials
# - Add your Notion integration token (required)
# - Update directory paths if needed (optional)
```

## Setup Notion Integration

### 1. Create Internal Integration

> **Note:** You must be a Workspace Owner to create integrations.

1. Go to **https://www.notion.so/my-integrations**
2. Click **"+ New integration"**
3. Fill in the integration details:
   - **Name:** `Workspace Analytics Bot` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Associated workspace:** Select your workspace from dropdown
4. Click **Submit**

### 2. Configure Integration Capabilities

After creating the integration, configure its permissions in the **Capabilities** tab:

**Required Capabilities:**
- ✅ **Read content** - To read page metadata and content
- ✅ **Read user information** - To get user names and activity (email addresses not needed)

**NOT Required:**
- ❌ **Insert content** - No write permissions needed
- ❌ **Update content** - No write permissions needed
- ❌ **Read comments** - Not used by this tool

> **Security Note:** This tool only reads data and never modifies your Notion workspace.

### 3. Get Integration Token (Secret)

1. In your integration settings, go to the **Secrets** tab (or **Configuration** tab)
2. Copy the **Internal Integration Secret**
   - Modern tokens start with: `ntn_`
   - Legacy tokens start with: `secret_`
3. Add to `.env` file:
   ```bash
   NOTION_TOKEN=ntn_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

> **Important:** Keep your integration token secret! Never commit it to version control or share it publicly.

### 4. Connect Integration to Workspace

The integration needs explicit permission to access your workspace pages.

**Option A: Grant Workspace-Wide Access (Recommended)**

1. Open your Notion workspace
2. Click **Settings & Members** in the sidebar
3. Go to **Connections** tab
4. Click **Add connection** or find your integration in the list
5. Select **"Workspace Analytics Bot"** (or your integration name)
6. This grants access to all current and future pages in the workspace

**Option B: Grant Page-Specific Access**

If you prefer to limit access to specific pages:

1. Navigate to any Notion page you want to analyze
2. Click the **•••** (More) menu at the top right
3. Scroll down and click **"+ Add connections"**
4. Search for and select your integration: **"Workspace Analytics Bot"**
5. Confirm - this grants access to the page and all its subpages

> **Note:** For complete workspace analytics, workspace-wide access is recommended.

### 5. Export Workspace

The tool requires a workspace export to extract page IDs and detect databases.

1. In Notion, go to **Settings & Members** → **Settings**
2. Scroll down to **Export all workspace content**
3. Configure export:
   - **Export format:** Markdown & CSV
   - **Include subpages:** ✅ Yes
   - **Create folders for subpages:** ✅ Yes (recommended)
4. Click **Export**
5. Wait for Notion to prepare the export (may take several minutes for large workspaces)
6. Download the ZIP file
7. Unzip and move contents to `./data/export/` directory:

```bash
# Example
unzip ~/Downloads/Export-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.zip -d ./data/export/
```

**Verify Export:**
```bash
ls -la ./data/export/
# Should contain many .md files and possibly .csv files for databases
```

## Usage

### Run Analysis

```bash
# Activate virtual environment (if not already active)
source venv/bin/activate

# Run analysis
python main.py
```

### First Run (May take 1-3 hours)

On the first run, the tool will:
1. ✅ Validate configuration (checks token and export directory)
2. 📥 Fetch all users from workspace via API
3. 🔍 Search all pages via API (rate-limited to 3 requests/second)
4. 📂 Extract page metadata from workspace export
5. 📊 Run analytics calculations (9 different analyses)
6. 📄 Generate Markdown report with 8 sections

**Performance:**
- ~500 pages: ~3-5 minutes
- ~2,800 pages: ~15-20 minutes (as seen in your workspace)
- ~10,000 pages: ~1-2 hours
- Rate limited to 3 requests/second (Notion API requirement)

All API responses are cached, so subsequent runs are much faster.

### Subsequent Runs (~10-30 seconds)

After the first run, cached data is used:
- ⚡ No API calls needed (uses cache)
- 📊 Analytics recalculated from cached data
- 📄 New report generated instantly

### Force Refresh

To fetch fresh data from Notion API:

```bash
# Clear cache to force API calls
rm -rf data/cache/*

# Run analysis (will fetch fresh data)
python main.py
```

## Output

Status:                All passing
```

### Code Quality

This project follows Python best practices:
- ✅ Type hints for all function signatures (`-> Dict[str, Any]`)
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests with pytest
- ✅ Mocked API calls (no network dependencies in tests)
- ✅ Separation of concerns (config, API, extraction, analytics, reporting)
- ✅ Defensive programming (error handling, validation)
- ✅ Clean code principles (single responsibility, DRY)

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "NOTION_TOKEN not set or invalid"

```bash
# Check .env file exists and has token
cat .env | grep NOTION_TOKEN

# Should output:
# NOTION_TOKEN=ntn_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# If missing, copy from integration settings
```

### Error: "Export directory not found" or "No pages found in export"

```bash
# Verify export path exists and has content
ls -la ./data/export/

# Should contain .md files and potentially .csv files
# If empty, re-download workspace export and unzip to this directory
```

### Error: "Could not retrieve users" or API errors

**Possible causes:**
1. Integration token is invalid or expired
2. Integration doesn't have workspace access
3. Internet connection issue

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Test API connection manually
python -c "from src.api_client import NotionAPIClient; client = NotionAPIClient(); users = client.get_all_users(); print(f'Success: {len(users)} users')"

# If this fails, regenerate integration token:
# 1. Go to notion.so/my-integrations
# 2. Select your integration
# 3. Secrets tab → Regenerate token
# 4. Update .env with new token
```

### Error: "Rate limit exceeded" (429 errors)

```python
# In config.py, reduce requests per second
REQUESTS_PER_SECOND = 2  # Slower but safer (default is 3)
```

### Memory Issues (Large Workspaces with 50,000+ pages)

For very large workspaces:
```bash
# Monitor memory usage
python main.py  # Watch for memory warnings

# If needed, process in batches by modifying config.py
# Or run on a machine with more RAM
```

### Cache Corruption or Stale Data

```bash
# Clear cache and fetch fresh data
rm -rf data/cache/*
python main.py

# This forces new API calls and may take 1-3 hours
```

### Report Shows Negative or Confusing Numbers

This has been fixed in the latest version:
- ✅ "Inactive Users" now correctly shows current non-creators (not negative)
- ✅ Deleted user content is tracked separately
- ✅ Clear explanations in "About this data" section

If you see issues, ensure you're running the latest version.

## Performance

**Tested Workspaces:**
- ✅ 500 pages: ~3-5 minutes first run
- ✅ 2,812 pages: ~15-20 minutes first run (your workspace)
- ✅ 10,000 pages: ~1-2 hours first run
- ✅ 50,000 pages: ~4-8 hours first run

**System Requirements:**
- **Memory:** ~500MB for 25,000 pages
- **Storage:** ~50MB for cache (2,800 pages)
- **Network:** Rate-limited to 3 requests/second

**Optimization:**
- All API responses are cached (users, pages, metadata)
- Subsequent runs use cache: ~10-30 seconds
- DataFrame operations optimized with pandas
- Progress bars show real-time status

## Security & Privacy

**What This Tool Does:**
- ✅ Reads page metadata (created time, edited time, creators)
- ✅ Reads user names (not email addresses)
- ✅ Calculates analytics locally on your machine
- ✅ Stores everything in local cache

**What This Tool Does NOT Do:**
- ❌ Never modifies or writes to Notion
- ❌ Never reads page content (only metadata)
- ❌ Never sends data to external servers
- ❌ Never shares your Notion data anywhere

**Data Storage:**
- Integration token: Stored in `.env` (gitignored)
- API responses: Cached in `data/cache/` (gitignored)
- Reports: Generated in `data/output/` (gitignored)
- No data leaves your local machine
