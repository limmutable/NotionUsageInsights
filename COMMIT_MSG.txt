Fix inactive users calculation and add deleted user tracking

This commit improves analytics accuracy by properly handling deleted
users and adds clear explanations to the generated reports.

Analytics Changes (src/analytics.py):
- Track current creators vs deleted creators separately
- Fix inactive users metric (current users who never created pages)
  - Previously showed -9 (nonsensical: 18 current - 27 total contributors)
  - Now correctly shows 6 (current users who haven't created pages)
- Add new fields to summary metrics:
  - current_creators: Active users still in workspace
  - deleted_creators: Removed users whose pages remain
- Update cost calculations to use current_creators instead of all contributors

Report Builder Changes (src/report_builder.py):
- Add "About this data" section explaining all metrics
- Update Executive Summary with clearer language:
  - Explain total pages = all pages across all time periods
  - Show current vs deleted creator breakdown
  - Display inactive users as percentage
- Add new Quick Stats rows:
  - "Total Users (Current)" - clarifies these are active users
  - "Current Active Creators" - users still in workspace
  - "Deleted User Pages" - content from removed users
- Update Key Insights with specific numbers and percentages
- Unicode emojis (✅ ⚠️ ❌) render correctly in Notion

Testing (tests/test_report_builder.py):
- Update test fixtures with new metrics
- All 28 report builder tests passing

Other Changes:
- Update .gitignore to exclude timestamped markdown output files

Fixes issue where users were confused by "27 of 18 users" and
negative inactive user counts. Reports now clearly explain that
workspace has 18 current users, 12 have created pages, 15 deleted
users created pages that still remain, and 6 current users are inactive.
